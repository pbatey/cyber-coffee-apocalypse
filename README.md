## Cyber Coffee Apocalypse

A Game to promote good security practices.

# Running

The application can be run as a web-application, in the ios simulator, or in the android emulator.
* meteor
* meteor run ios
* meteor run amdroid

The ios and android environments require some prerequists be installed, see [https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Mobile-Dev-Install:-iOS-on-Mac]() and [https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Mobile-Development-Install:-Android-on-Mac]() for more info.

_Note: I'm having trouble with android emulator install -- guess there was a recent change do Android Stuidio that the Meteor folks haven't quite worked out: [https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/5358]()._

# Development

The game is built using [Meteor](www.meteor.com), a framework for developing mobile using web technologies.

The main entry points for the application are:

* cyber-cofee-apocalypse.html
* cyber-cofee-apocalypse.js
* cyber-cofee-apocalypse.css
